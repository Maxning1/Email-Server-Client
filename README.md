# Email-Server-Client
This is the Java code for the Email Server/Client I created for my school's student council. 
Ensure that the _messages.dat file is changed before using the code, as the file should contain only messages that are relevant.
Read the file on "howtoruntheEmailserver" for tips/info on how the server works.
BEFORE RUNNING PLEASE NOTE:
You will need a 3 files to store account data, message data and deleted message data.
These files must be called _account.dat, _message.dat and _available.dat respectively.
If you don't want to use these names, you will need to change the variable file names in the Globals program.
