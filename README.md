# Email-Server-Client
This is the Java code for the Email Server/Client I created for my school's student council. 
Ensure that the _messages.dat file is changed before using the code, as the file should contain only messages that are relevant.
Read the file on "howtoruntheEmailserver" for tips/info on how the server works.
